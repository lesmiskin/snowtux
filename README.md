# Simple 3D Game Engine by Les Miskin
An easy-to-comprehend 3D game engine, designed as a platform for learning and experimentation. 
Forking and hacking is encouraged =)

    - Development Libraries (for Windows and Visual C++)
2. Download GLEW from http://glew.sourceforge.net/
3. From the Runtime Binaries file, extract the `SDL2.0.DLL` file to your `C:\Windows` directory.
4. Extract the Development Libraries file to `C:\SDK` (e.g. `C:\SDK\SDL2-2.0.9`).
5. Extract the GLEW file to `C:\SDK` (e.g. `C:\SDK\glew-2.1.0`).
