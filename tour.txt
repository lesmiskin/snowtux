Section: THE GAME LOOP
----------------------

The main part of our game. The loop keeps our game running, runs our game logic, and causes graphics to be shown
onscreen. Think of what happens each time the loop runs, as being a tiny portion of "what's going on" in your 
game. This is called a "frame" (like the frames of a video).

Note: We don't necessarily run a frame each time the loop happens. This would mean that our game would run too
fast, or at different speeds on different computers. To make sure our game runs at a constant speed, we do
a little calculation to "skip" frames if we're running too quickly.
